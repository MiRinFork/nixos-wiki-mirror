[Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/) is a digital distribution platform for video games, offering a vast library for purchase, download, and management. On NixOS, Steam is generally easy to install and use, often working "out-of-the-box". It supports running many Windows games on Linux through its compatibility layer, <a href="#Proton" class="wikilink" title="Proton">Proton</a>.[^1]

## Установка

<div lang="en" dir="ltr" class="mw-content-ltr">

#### Shell

</div>

<div lang="en" dir="ltr" class="mw-content-ltr">

To temporarily use Steam-related tools like `steam-run` (for FHS environments) or `steamcmd` (for server management or tools like steam-tui setup) in a shell environment, you can run:

</div>

``` console
$ nix-shell -p steam-run # For FHS environment
$ nix-shell -p steamcmd  # For steamcmd
```

<div lang="en" dir="ltr" class="mw-content-ltr">

This provides the tools in your current shell without adding them to your system configuration. For `steamcmd` to work correctly for some tasks (like initializing for steam-tui), you might need to run it once to generate necessary files, as shown in the <a href="#steam-tui" class="wikilink" title=" steam-tui section"> steam-tui section</a>.

## Tips and tricks

</div>

<div lang="en" dir="ltr" class="mw-content-ltr">

### Improving Performance

</div>

<div lang="en" dir="ltr" class="mw-content-ltr">

You can utilize [GameMode](https://github.com/FeralInteractive/gamemode), a combination of a library and daemon for Linux that allows games to request a set of optimizations to be temporarily applied to the host operating system and/or a game process.

</div>

``` nixos
programs.gamemode.enable = true;
```

<div lang="en" dir="ltr" class="mw-content-ltr">

### Gamescope Compositor / "Boot to Steam Deck"

</div>

<div lang="en" dir="ltr" class="mw-content-ltr">

Gamescope can function as a minimal desktop environment, meaning you can launch it from a TTY and have an experience very similar to the Steam Deck hardware console.

</div>

``` nix
# Clean Quiet Boot
boot = {
  kernelParams = [
    "quiet"
    "splash"
    "console=/dev/null"
  ];
  plymouth.enable = true;
};

programs = {
  gamescope = {
    enable = true;
    capSysNice = true;
  };
  steam.gamescopeSession.enable = true;
};

# Gamescope Auto Boot from TTY (example)
services = {
  xserver.enable = false; # Assuming no other Xserver needed
  getty.autologinUser = <"USERNAME_HERE">;
  greetd = {
    enable = true;
    settings = {
      default_session = {
        command = "${lib.getExe pkgs.gamescope} -W 1920 -H 1080 -f -e --xwayland-count 2 --hdr-enabled --hdr-itm-enabled -- steam -pipewire-dmabuf -gamepadui -steamdeck -steamos3 > /dev/null 2>&1";
        user = <"USERNAME HERE">;
      };
    };
  };
};
```

<div lang="en" dir="ltr" class="mw-content-ltr">

### Gamescope HDR

</div>

<div lang="en" dir="ltr" class="mw-content-ltr">

In order for HDR to work within gamescope, you might need to separately enable the `enableWsi` option

</div>

``` nix
programs.gamescope = {
  enable = true;
  enableWsi = true;
  capSysNice = false;
};
```

<div lang="en" dir="ltr" class="mw-content-ltr">

Additionally, it may be necessary to force HDR in gamescope with the argument `--hdr-debug-force-output` when configuring your game's launch options in steam (see the example below).

</div>

``` bash
gamescope -W 3840 -H 2160 -r 120 -f --adaptive-sync --hdr-enabled --hdr-debug-force-output --mangoapp -- %command%
```

### steam-tui

<div lang="en" dir="ltr" class="mw-content-ltr">

If you want the steam-tui client, you'll have to install it. It relies on `steamcmd` being set up, so you'll need to run `steamcmd` once to generate the necessary configuration files. First, ensure `steamcmd` is available (e.g., via `nix-shell -p steamcmd` or by adding it to `environment.systemPackages`), then run:

</div>

``` bash
steamcmd +quit # This initializes steamcmd's directory structure
```

<div lang="en" dir="ltr" class="mw-content-ltr">

Then install and run `steam-tui`. You may need to log in within `steamcmd` first if `steam-tui` has issues:

</div>

``` bash
# (Inside steamcmd prompt, if needed for full login before steam-tui)
# login <username> <password> <steam_2fa_code>
# quit
```

<div lang="en" dir="ltr" class="mw-content-ltr">

After setup, `steam-tui` (if installed e.g. via `home.packages` or `environment.systemPackages`) should start fine.

</div>

<div lang="en" dir="ltr" class="mw-content-ltr">

### FHS environment only

</div>

<div lang="en" dir="ltr" class="mw-content-ltr">

To run proprietary games or software downloaded from the internet that expect a typical Linux Filesystem Hierarchy Standard (FHS), you can use `steam-run`. This provides an FHS-like environment without needing to patch the software. Note that this is not necessary for clients installed from Nixpkgs (like Minigalaxy or Itch), which already use the FHS environment as needed. There are two options to make `steam-run` available: 1. Install `steam-run` system-wide or user-specifically:

</div>

``` nix
# In /etc/nixos/configuration.nix
environment.systemPackages = with pkgs; [
  steam-run
];
```

<div lang="en" dir="ltr" class="mw-content-ltr">

2\. If you need more flexibility or want to use an overridden Steam package's FHS environment:

</div>

``` nix
# In /etc/nixos/configuration.nix
environment.systemPackages = with pkgs; [
  (steam.override { /* Your overrides here */ }).run
];
```

### Proton

<div lang="en" dir="ltr" class="mw-content-ltr">

You should be able to play most Windows games using Proton. If a game has a native Linux version that causes issues on NixOS, you can force the use of Proton by selecting a specific Proton version in the game's compatibility settings in Steam.

</div>

<div lang="en" dir="ltr" class="mw-content-ltr">

By default, Steam also looks for custom Proton versions in `~/.steam/root/compatibilitytools.d`. The environment variable `STEAM_EXTRA_COMPAT_TOOLS_PATHS` can be set to add other search paths.

</div>

<div lang="en" dir="ltr" class="mw-content-ltr">

Declarative install of custom Proton versions (e.g. GE-Proton):

</div>

``` nix
programs.steam.extraCompatPackages = with pkgs; [
  proton-ge-bin
];
```

<div lang="en" dir="ltr" class="mw-content-ltr">

Manual management of multiple Proton versions can be done with ProtonUp-Qt:

</div>

``` nix
environment.systemPackages = with pkgs; [
  protonup-qt
];
```

<div lang="en" dir="ltr" class="mw-content-ltr">

### Overriding the Steam package

</div>

<div lang="en" dir="ltr" class="mw-content-ltr">

In some cases, you may need to override the default Steam package to provide missing dependencies or modify its build. Use the `programs.steam.package` option for this. Steam on NixOS runs many games in an FHS environment, but the Steam client itself or certain tools might need extra libraries.

</div>

<div lang="en" dir="ltr" class="mw-content-ltr">

Example: Adding Bumblebee and Primus (for NVIDIA Optimus):

</div>

``` nix
programs.steam.package = pkgs.steam.override {
  extraPkgs = pkgs': with pkgs'; [ bumblebee primus ];
};

# For 32-bit applications with Steam, if using steamFull:
# programs.steam.package = pkgs.steamFull.override { extraPkgs = pkgs': with pkgs'; [ bumblebee primus ]; };
```

<div lang="en" dir="ltr" class="mw-content-ltr">

Example: Adding Xorg libraries for Gamescope (when used within Steam):

</div>

``` nix
programs.steam.package = pkgs.steam.override {
  extraPkgs = pkgs': with pkgs'; [
    libXcursor
    libXi
    libXinerama
    libXScrnSaver
    libpng
    libpulseaudio
    libvorbis
    stdenv.cc.cc.lib # Provides libstdc++.so.6
    libkrb5
    keyutils
    # Add other libraries as needed
  ];
};
```

<div lang="en" dir="ltr" class="mw-content-ltr">

### Fix missing icons for games in GNOME dock and activities overview

</div>

<div lang="en" dir="ltr" class="mw-content-ltr">

GNOME uses the window class to determine the icon associated with a window. Steam currently doesn't set the required key for this in its .desktop files[^2], but you can fix this manually by editing the `StartupWMClass` key for each game's .desktop file, found under `~/.local/share/applications/`.

</div>

<div lang="en" dir="ltr" class="mw-content-ltr">

For games running through Proton, the value should be `steam_app_`<game_id> (where <game_id> matches the value after <steam://rungameid/> on the `Exec` line). To automate this with <a href="Special:MyLanguage/Home_Manager" class="wikilink" title="Home Manager">Home Manager</a> (executed on every rebuild):

</div>

``` nix
home.activation.fixSteamIcons = lib.hm.dag.entryAfter [ "writeBoundary" ] ''
  for f in ~/.local/share/applications/*.desktop; do
    id=$(grep -Eo 'steam://rungameid/[0-9]+' "$f" | sed 's#.*/##') || true
    [ -n "$id" ] || continue
    last=$(tail -n1 "$f" || true)
    want="StartupWMClass=steam_app_$id"
    [ "$last" = "$want" ] || echo "$want" >> "$f"
  done
'';
```

<div lang="en" dir="ltr" class="mw-content-ltr">

For games running natively, the value should match the game's main executable.

</div>

<div lang="en" dir="ltr" class="mw-content-ltr">

For example, the modified .desktop file for Valheim looks like this:

</div>

``` desktop
[Desktop Entry]
Name=Valheim
Comment=Play this game on Steam
Exec=steam steam://rungameid/892970
Icon=steam_icon_892970
Terminal=false
Type=Application
Categories=Game;
StartupWMClass=valheim.x86_64
```

<span id="Troubleshooting"></span>

## Устранение неполадок

<div lang="en" dir="ltr" class="mw-content-ltr">

For all issues: first run `steam -dev -console` through the terminal and read the output.

</div>

<div lang="en" dir="ltr" class="mw-content-ltr">

### Steam fails to start. What do I do?

</div>

<div lang="en" dir="ltr" class="mw-content-ltr">

One common issue preventing steam from being able to start, at least on `x86-64` platforms, is not having the following options enabled in your `/etc/nixos/hardware-configuration.nix`:

</div>

``` nix
 {
   hardware.graphics.enable = true;
   hardware.graphics.enable32Bit = true;
 }
```

<div lang="en" dir="ltr" class="mw-content-ltr">

If you have those options set (or 32-bit isn't applicable to your system/platform) and still can't run steam, then run `strace steam -dev -console 2> steam.logs` in the terminal. If `strace` is not installed, temporarily install it using `nix-shell -p strace` or `nix run nixpkgs#strace -- steam -dev -console 2> steam.logs` (if using Flakes). After that, create a bug report.

</div>

<div lang="en" dir="ltr" class="mw-content-ltr">

### Steam is not updated

</div>

<div lang="en" dir="ltr" class="mw-content-ltr">

When you restart Steam after an update, it starts the old version. ([\#181904](https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/issues/181904)) A workaround is to remove the user files in `/home/<USER>/.local/share/Steam/userdata`. This can be done with `rm -rf /home/<USER>/.local/share/Steam/userdata` in the terminal or with your file manager. After that, Steam can be set up again by restarting.

</div>

<div lang="en" dir="ltr" class="mw-content-ltr">

### Game fails to start

</div>

<div lang="en" dir="ltr" class="mw-content-ltr">

Games may fail to start because they lack dependencies (this should be added to the script, for now), or because they cannot be patched. The steps to launch a game directly are:

- Patch the script/binary if you can
- Add a file named steam_appid.txt in the binary folder, with the appid as contents (it can be found in the stdout from steam)
- Using the LD_LIBRARY_PATH from the nix/store steam script, with some additions, launch the game binary

</div>

``` bash
LD_LIBRARY_PATH=~/.steam/bin32:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:/nix/store/pfsa... blabla ...curl-7.29.0/lib:. ./Osmos.bin32 (if you could not patchelf the game, call ld.so directly with the binary as parameter)
```

<div lang="en" dir="ltr" class="mw-content-ltr">

Note: If a game gets stuck on Installing scripts, check for a DXSETUP.EXE process and run it manually, then restart the game launch.

</div>

#### Changing the driver on AMD GPUs

</div>

<div lang="en" dir="ltr" class="mw-content-ltr">

Sometimes, changing the driver on AMD GPUs helps. To try this, first, install multiple drivers such as radv and amdvlk:

</div>

``` nix
hardware.graphics = {
  ## radv: an open-source Vulkan driver from freedesktop
  enable32Bit = true;

  ## amdvlk: an open-source Vulkan driver from AMD
  extraPackages = [ pkgs.amdvlk ];
  extraPackages32 = [ pkgs.driversi686Linux.amdvlk ];
};
```

<div lang="en" dir="ltr" class="mw-content-ltr">

In the presence of both drivers, <a href="Special:MyLanguage/Steam" class="wikilink" title="Steam">Steam</a> will default to amdvlk. The amdvlk driver can be considered more correct regarding Vulkan specification implementation, but less performant than radv. However, this tradeoff between correctness and performance can sometimes make or break the gaming experience.

</div>

<div lang="en" dir="ltr" class="mw-content-ltr">

To "reset" your driver to radv when both radv and amdvlk are installed, set either `AMD_VULKAN_ICD = "RADV"` or `VK_ICD_FILENAMES = "/run/opengl-driver/share/vulkan/icd.d/radeon_icd.x86_64.json"` environment variable. For example, if you start <a href="Special:MyLanguage/Steam" class="wikilink" title="Steam">Steam</a> from the shell, you can enable radv for the current session by running `AMD_VULKAN_ICD="RADV" steam`. If you are unsure which driver you currently use, you can launch a game with [MangoHud](https://github.com/flightlessmango/MangoHud) enabled, which has the capability to show what driver is currently in use.

</div>

### SteamVR

<div lang="en" dir="ltr" class="mw-content-ltr">

The setcap issue at SteamVR start can be fixed with: `sudo setcap CAP_SYS_NICE+ep ~/.local/share/Steam/steamapps/common/SteamVR/bin/linux64/vrcompositor-launcher`

</div>

<div lang="en" dir="ltr" class="mw-content-ltr">

### Gamescope fails to launch when used within Steam

</div>

<div lang="en" dir="ltr" class="mw-content-ltr">

Gamescope may fail to start due to missing Xorg libraries. ([\#214275](https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/issues/214275)) To resolve this override the steam package to add them:

</div>

``` nix
programs.steam.package = pkgs.steam.override {
  extraPkgs = pkgs': with pkgs'; [
    libXcursor
    libXi
    libXinerama
    libXScrnSaver
    libpng
    libpulseaudio
    libvorbis
    stdenv.cc.cc.lib # Provides libstdc++.so.6
    libkrb5
    keyutils
    # Add other libraries as needed
  ];
};
```

<div lang="en" dir="ltr" class="mw-content-ltr">

### Udev rules for additional Gamepads

</div>

<div lang="en" dir="ltr" class="mw-content-ltr">

In specific scenarios gamepads, might require some additional configuration in order to function properly in the form of udev rules. This can be achieved with `services.udev.extraRules`.

</div>

<div lang="en" dir="ltr" class="mw-content-ltr">

The following example is for the 8bitdo Ultimate Bluetooth controller, different controllers will require knowledge of the vendor and product ID for the device:

</div>

``` nix
  services.udev.extraRules = ''
    SUBSYSTEM=="input", ATTRS{idVendor}=="2dc8", ATTRS{idProduct}=="3106", MODE="0660", GROUP="input"
  '';
```

<div lang="en" dir="ltr" class="mw-content-ltr">

To find the vendor and product ID of a device [usbutils](https://search.nixos.org/packages?channel=unstable&show=usbutils&from=0&size=50&sort=relevance&type=packages&query=usbutils) might be useful

</div>

<div lang="en" dir="ltr" class="mw-content-ltr">

### Steam controller mouse input issues

</div>

<div lang="en" dir="ltr" class="mw-content-ltr">

Mouse input on the controller may fail to take control of the visual cursor. In this instance, the input is still registered, but the cursor does not move. A fix for this is to preload Steam with extest. The Steam package already has an option for it:

</div>

``` nix
  programs.steam = {
    extest.enable = true;
  };
```
