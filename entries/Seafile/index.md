## Introduction

<strong>Seafile</strong> is a file-hosting software system with a simple web interface and client applications for file access. Seafile's functionality is similar to file-hosting services such as Dropbox and Google Drive.

As opposed to <a href="Nextcloud" class="wikilink" title="Nextcloud">Nextcloud</a>, Seafile offers simpler user administration and much better file-server performance.

## Setup

Minimal configuration of Seafile:

``` nix
  services.seafile = {
    enable = true;

    adminEmail = "admin@example.com";
    initialAdminPassword = "change this later!";

    ccnetSettings.General.SERVICE_URL = "https://seafile.example.com";

    seafileSettings = {
      fileserver = {
        host = "unix:/run/seafile/server.sock";
      };
    };
  };
```

Use nginx to serve Seafile from a unix socket:

``` nix
  services.nginx.virtualHosts."seafile.example.com" = {
    sslCertificate = "/path/to/cert.pem";
    sslCertificateKey = "/path/to/key.key";
    forceSSL = true;
    enableACME = true;
    locations = {
      "/" = {
        proxyPass = "http://unix:/run/seahub/gunicorn.sock";
        extraConfig = ''
          proxy_set_header   Host $host;
          proxy_set_header   X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
          proxy_set_header   X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
          proxy_set_header   X-Forwarded-Host $server_name;
          proxy_read_timeout  1200s;
          client_max_body_size 0;
        '';
      };
      "/seafhttp" = {
        proxyPass = "http://unix:/run/seafile/server.sock";
        extraConfig = ''
          rewrite ^/seafhttp(.*)$ $1 break;
          client_max_body_size 0;
          proxy_set_header   X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
          proxy_connect_timeout  36000s;
          proxy_read_timeout  36000s;
          proxy_send_timeout  36000s;
          send_timeout  36000s;
        '';
      };
    };
  };
```

## Additional configuration

``` nix
  services.seafile = {
    [...]
    seafileSettings = {
      quota.default = "50"; # Amount of GB allotted to users
      history.keep_days = "14"; # Remove deleted files after 14 days

      fileserver = {
        host = "unix:/run/seafile/server.sock";
        web_token_expire_time = 18000; # Expire the token in 5h to allow longer uploads
      };
    };

    # Enable weekly collection of freed blocks
    gc = {
      enable = true;
      dates = [ "Sun 03:00:00" ];
    };
  };
```

To change the directory of the database, create the directory with the appropriate permissions, `chown -R seafile:seafile` it and set:

``` nix
  services.seafile = {
    [...]
    dataDir = "/path/seafile/data";
  };
```

## Additional info

The `initialAdminPassword` is set only once when the server is first initialized. Any changes to it afterward will have no effect on it. If you cannot log in for the first time, delete `/var/lib/seafile/data`, remove the Seafile configuration from your config, rebuild, re-add it, and the password will be set in the next rebuild.

Logs for Seafile and SeaHub (Seafile's web interface) are stored respectively in `/var/log/seafile/server.log` and `/var/log/seafile/seahub.log`.

For additional options, refer to the [Seafile Admin Manual](https://manual.seafile.com/11.0/config/)
